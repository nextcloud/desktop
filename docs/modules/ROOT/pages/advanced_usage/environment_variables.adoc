= Environment Variables

The behavior of the client can also be controlled using environment variables.
The value of the environment variables overrides the values in the configuration file.

Note that most environment variables only exist for debugging or testing.
They are not officially supported and may change from version to version.
If you end up relying on a setting only available through an environment variable, please create a bug report.

The environment variables are:

[cols="2,1,4", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Default
| Description

| `OWNCLOUD_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 10000000 (or 10 MB)
| Specifies the initial chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.
The client will dynamically adjust this size within the maximum and minimum bounds (see below).
To disable chunking completely, set `OWNCLOUD_CHUNK_SIZE=0` .

| `OWNCLOUD_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 100000000 (or 100 MB)
| Specifies the maximum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `OWNCLOUD_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE`
| 1000000 (or 1 MB)
| Specifies the minimum chunk size of uploaded files in bytes.

| `OWNCLOUD_TARGET_CHUNK_UPLOAD_DURATION`
| 60000
| Target duration in milliseconds for chunk uploads.
The client adjusts the chunk size until each chunk upload takes approximately this long.
Set to 0 to disable dynamic chunk sizing.

| `OWNCLOUD_CHUNKING_NG`
| depend on server capability
| Force-enable ("1") or force-disable ("0") the NG chunking algorithm.

| `OWNCLOUD_TIMEOUT`
| 300 
| The timeout for network connections in seconds.

| `OWNCLOUD_CRITICAL_FREE_SPACE_BYTES` 
| 50*1000*1000 bytes 
| The minimum disk space needed for operation.
A fatal error is raised if less free space is available.

| `OWNCLOUD_FREE_SPACE_BYTES` 
| 250*1000*1000 bytes 
| Downloads that would reduce the free space below this value are skipped.
More information available under the "Low Disk Space" section.

| `OWNCLOUD_MAX_PARALLEL` 
| 6 
| Maximum number of parallel jobs.

| `OWNCLOUD_BLACKLIST_TIME_MIN` 
| 25 
| Minimum timeout, in seconds, for blacklisted files.

| `OWNCLOUD_BLACKLIST_TIME_MAX` 
| 24*60*60 (or one day)
| Maximum timeout, in seconds, for blacklisted files.

| `OWNCLOUD_HTTP2_ENABLED`
| depend on Qt version
| Force-enable ("1") or force-disable ("0") HTTP2 support.
Note that HTTP2 use also depends on whether the server supports it.

| `OWNCLOUD_MINIMAL_TRAY_MENU`
| unset
| If set a minimal tray menu is used.
Helpful if a platform's tray has problematic behavior.

| `OWNCLOUD_TRAY_UPDATE_WHILE_VISIBLE`

| `OWNCLOUD_FORCE_TRAY_SHOW_HIDE`
| unset
| Set to "1" to reestablish the tray icon every time the menu changes.

| `OWNCLOUD_FORCE_TRAY_FAKE_DOUBLE_CLICK`
| unset
| Set to "1" if single tray clicks sometimes get recognized as double clicks.

| `OWNCLOUD_FORCE_TRAY_MANUAL_VISIBILITY`
| unset
| Set to "1" if the tray menu is flickering while opened.

| `OWNCLOUD_FORCE_TRAY_NO_ABOUT_TO_SHOW`
| unset
| Set to "1" if the tray menu sometimes contains stale entries.

| `OWNCLOUD_FULL_LOCAL_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL`
| 3600000 (1 hour)
| Maximum time in milliseconds that fast local discovery is allowed for after a full local discovery.
Set to 0 to always require full local discovery.
Set to -1 to never require full local discovery.

| `OWNCLOUD_SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE`
| depends on filesystem
| Set a specific sqlite journal mode.

| `OWNCLOUD_SQLITE_LOCKING_MODE`
| EXCLUSIVE
| Set a specific sqlite locking mode.

| `OWNCLOUD_SQLITE_TEMP_STORE`
| unset
| Set the given temp_store on the sqlite database.

| `OWNCLOUD_DISABLE_CHECKSUM_COMPUTATIONS`
| unset
| Set to disable all file checksum computations.

| `OWNCLOUD_DISABLE_CHECKSUM_UPLOAD`
| unset
| Set to disable computing checksums for uploaded files.

| `OWNCLOUD_CONTENT_CHECKSUM_TYPE`
| SHA1
| Select the file checksumming algorithm.
"Adler32", "MD5", "SHA1", "SHA256", "SHA3-256" are valid, but not all have server support.

| `OWNCLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFLICT_FILES`
