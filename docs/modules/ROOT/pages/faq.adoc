Some Files Are Continuously Uploaded to the Server, Even When They Are
Not Modified.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible that another program is changing the modification date of
the file. If the file is uses the `.eml` extension, Windows
automatically and continually changes all files, unless you remove
`\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers`
from the windows registry. See

Syncing Stops When Attempting To Sync Deeper Than 100 Sub-directories.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The sync client has been intentionally limited to sync no deeper than
100 sub-directories. The hard limit exists to guard against bugs with
cycles like symbolic link loops. When a deeply nested directory is
excluded from synchronization it will be listed with other ignored files
and directories in the "Not synced" tab of the "Activity" pane.

I See a Warning Message for Unsupported Versions.
-------------------------------------------------

Keeping software up to date is crucial for file integrity and security –
if software is outdated, there can be unfixed bugs. That’s why you
should always upgrade your software when there is a new version.

The ownCloud Desktop Client talks to a server, e.g. the ownCloud server
– so you don’t only have to upgrade your client when there is a new
version for it, also the server has to be kept up-to-date by your
sysadmin.

Starting with version 2.5.0, the client will show a warning message if
you connect to an outdated or unsupported server:

**Because earlier versions are not maintained anymore, only ownCloud
10.0.0 or higher is supported.** So if you encounter such a message, you
should ask your administrator to upgrade ownCloud to a secure version.

An important feature of the ownCloud Client is checksumming – each time
you download or upload a file, the client and the server both check if
the file was corrupted during the sync. This way you can be sure that
you don’t lose any files.

There are servers out there which don’t have checksumming implemented on
their side, or which are not tested by ownCloud’s QA team. They can’t
ensure file integrity, they have potential security issues, and we can’t
guarantee that they are compatible with the ownCloud Desktop Client.

*We care about your data and want it to be safe.* That’s why you see
this warning message, so you can evaluate your data security. Don’t
worry – you can still use the client with an unsupported server, but do
so at your own risk.

There Was A Warning About Changes In Synchronized Folders Not Being
Tracked Reliably.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On linux when the synchronized folder contains very many subfolders the
operating system may not allow for enough inotify watches to monitor the
changes in all of them.

In this case the client will not be able to immediately start the
synchronization process when a file in one of the unmonitored folders
changes. Instead, the client will show the warning and manually scan
folders for changes in a regular interval (two hours by default).

This problem can be solved by setting the fs.inotify.max_user_watches
sysctl to a higher value. This can usually be done either temporarily:

....
echo 524288 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
....

or permanently by adjusting `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

I Want To Move My Local Sync Folder
-----------------------------------

The ownCloud desktop client does not provide a way to change the local
sync directory. However, it can be done, though it is a bit unorthodox.
Specifically, you have to:

1.  Remove the existing connection which syncs to the wrong directory
2.  Add a new connection which syncs to the desired directory

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/setup/ownCloud-remove_existing_connection.png[image]

To do so, in the client UI, which you can see above, click the
"*Account*" drop-down menu and then click "Remove". This will display a
"*Confirm Account Removal*" dialog window.

If you're sure, click "*Remove connection*".

Then, click the Account drop-down menu again, and this time click "*Add
new*".

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/setup/ownCloud-replacement_connection_wizard.png[image]

This opens the ownCloud Connection Wizard, which you can see above,
_but_ with an extra option. This option provides the ability to either:
keep the existing data (synced by the previous connection) or to start a
clean sync (erasing the existing data).

Important

Be careful before choosing the "Start a clean sync" option. The old sync
folder _may_ contain a considerable amount of data, ranging into the
gigabytes or terabytes. If it does, after the client creates the new
connection, it will have to download *all* of that information again.
Instead, first move or copy the old local sync folder, containing a copy
of the existing files, to the new location. Then, when creating the new
connection choose "_keep existing data_" instead. The ownCloud client
will check the files in the newly-added sync folder and find that they
match what is on the server and not need to download anything.

Make your choice and click "*Connect...*". This will then step you
through the Connection Wizard, just as you did when you setup the
previous sync connection, but giving you the opportunity to choose a new
sync directory.
