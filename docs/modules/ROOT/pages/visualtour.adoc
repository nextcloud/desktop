visual tour, usage

Icon
----

The ownCloud Client remains in the background and is visible as an icon
in the system tray (Windows, KDE), status bar (MAC OS X), or
notification area (Ubuntu).

Menu
----

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/menu.png[image]

A right click on the icon (left click on Ubuntu and Mac OS X) provides
the following menu:

* `Open ownCloud in browser`: Opens the ownCloud web interface
* `Open folder 'ownCloud'`: Opens the local folder. If multiple sync
targets have been defined, an entry will exist for each local folder.
* *Disk space indicator*: Shows how much space is used on the server.
* Operation indicator: Shows the status of the current sync process, or
`Up to date` if server and client are in sync.
* *Recent Changes*: shows the last six files modified by sync
operations, and provides access to the Sync status, which lists all
changes since the last restart of ownCloud Client.
* `Settings...`: provides access to the settings menu.
* `Help`: Opens a browser to display this help.
* `Log out`: Logs the client out of the server.
* `Quit ownCloud`: Quits ownCloud Client, ending a currently running
sync run.

Settings
--------

Account Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

account settings, user, password, Server URL

The `Account Settings tab` provides an executive summary about the
synced folders in the account and gives the ability to modify them.

Where:

* `Connected to <ownCloud instance> as <user>`: Indicates the ownCloud
server which the client is syncing with and the user account on that
server.
* `Add Folder Sync Connection...`: Provides the ability to add another
folder to the sync (see `Adding a folder sync connection`).
* `Pause/Resume`: Will pause the current sync or prevent the client from
starting a new sync. Resume will resume the sync process.
* `Remove`: Will remove the selected folder from being synced. This is
used, for instance, when there is a desire to sync only a few folders
and not the root. First, remove the root from sync, then add the folders
to sync as desired.
* `Storage Usage`: Provides further details on the storage utilization
on the ownCloud server.
* `Edit Ignored Files`: Provides a list of files which will be ignored,
i.e., will not sync between the client and server. The ignored files
editor allows adding patterns for files or directories that should be
excluded from the sync process. Besides normal characters, wild cards
may be used, an asterisk ‘*’ indicating multiple characters, or a
question mark ‘?’ indicating a single character.
* `Modify Account`: Allows the user to change the ownCloud server being
synced to. It brings up the Setting up an Account (see above) windows.

Adding a Folder Sync Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding a new sync is initiated by clicking `Add Folder Sync Connection`
in the `Account` settings.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/folderwizard_local.png[image]

The Directory and alias name must be unique.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/folderwizard_remote.png[image]

Select the folder on the server to sync with. It is important to note
that, a server folder can only sync to the client one time. So, in the
above example, the sync is to the server root directory and thus it is
not possible to select another folder under the root to sync.

Activity
~~~~~~~~

activity, recent changes, sync activity

The Activity window, which can be invoked either from the main menu
(`Recent Changes -> Details…`) or the Activity tab on the left side of
the settings window, provides an in-depth account of the recent sync
activity. It will show files that have not been synced because they are
on the ignored files list, or because they cannot be synced in a
cross-platform manner due to containing special characters that cannot
be stored on certain file systems.

General
~~~~~~~

general settings, auto start, startup, desktop notifications

The tab provides several useful options:

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/settings_general.png[image]

* `Launch on System Startup`: This option is automatically activated
once a user has conimaged his account. Un-checking the box will cause
ownCloud client to not launch on startup for a particular user.
* `Show Desktop Nofications`: When checked, bubble notifications when a
set of sync operations has been performed are provided.
* `Use Monochrome Icons`: Use less obtrusive icons. Especially useful on
Mac OS X.
* `About`: provides information about authors as well as build
conditions. This information is valuable when submitting a support
request.

Network
~~~~~~~

proxy settings, SOCKS, bandwith, throttling, limiting

This tab consolidates `Proxy Settings` and `Bandwith Limiting`:

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/settings_network.png[image]

Proxy Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `No Proxy`: Check this if ownCloud Client should circumvent the
default proxy conimaged on the system.
* `Use system proxy`: Default, will follow the systems proxy settings.
On Linux, this will only pick up the value of the variable `http_proxy`.
* `Specify proxy manually as`: Allows to specify custom proxy settings.
If you require to go through a HTTP(S) proxy server such as Squid or
Microsoft Forefront TMG, pick `HTTP(S)`. `SOCKSv5` on the other hand is
particularly useful in special company LAN setups, or in combination
with the OpenSSH dynamic application level forwarding feature (see
`ssh -D`).
* `Host`: Enter the host name or IP address of your proxy server,
followed by the port number. HTTP proxies usually listen on Ports 8080
(default) or
1.  SOCKS server usually listen on port 1080.
* `Proxy Server requires authentication`: Should be checked if the proxy
server does not allow anonymous usage. If checked, a username and
password must be provided.

Bandwidth Limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Download Bandwidth can be either unlimited (default) or limited to a
custom value. This is the bandwidth available for data flowing from the
ownCloud Server to the client.

The Upload Bandwidth, the bandwidth available or data flowing from the
ownCloud client to the server, has an additional option to limit
automatically.

When this option is checked, the ownCloud client will surrender
available bandwidth to other applications. Use this option if there are
issues with real time communication in conjunction with the ownCloud
Client.

[[ignoredFilesEditor-label]]
The Ignored Files Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ignored files, exclude files, pattern

ownCloud Client has the ability to exclude files from the sync process.
The ignored files editor allows editing of custom patterns for files or
directories that should be excluded from the sync process.

There is a system wide list of default ignore patterns. These global
defaults cannot be directly modified within the editor. Hovering with
the mouse will reveal the location of the global exclude definition
file.

image:/owncloud-docs/_images/ignored_files_editor.png[image]

Each line contains an ignore pattern string. Next to normal characters,
wildcards can be used to match an arbitrary number of characters,
designated by an asterisk (`*`) or a single character, designated by a
question mark (`?`). If a pattern ends with a slash character (`/`) the
pattern is only applied to directory components of the path to check.

If the checkbox is checked for a pattern in the editor it means that
files which are matched by this pattern are fleeting metadata which the
client will _remove_.

Note

Modifying the global exclude definition file might render the client
unusable or cause undesired behavior.

Note

Custom entries are currently not validated for syntactical correctness
by the editor, but might fail to load correctly.

In addition to this list, ownCloud Client always excludes files with
characters that cannot be synced to other file systems.

With version 1.5.0 it also ignores files that caused individual errors
while syncing for a three times. These are listed in the activity view.
There also is a button to retry the sync for another three times.

For more detailed information see `ignored-files-label`.
