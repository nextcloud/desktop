msgid "Nextcloud provides desktop sync clients to synchronize the contents of local directories from computers, tablets, and handheld devices to the Nextcloud server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:10
msgid "Synchronization is accomplished using csync_, a bidirectional file synchronizing tool that provides both a command line client as well as a library. A special module for csync was written to synchronize with the Nextcloud built-in WebDAV server."

#: ../../architecture.rst:24
msgid "The process of synchronization keeps files in two separate repositories the same. When synchronized:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:27
msgid "If a file is added to one repository it is copied to the other synchronized repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:28
msgid "When a file is changed in one repository, the change is propagated to any other synchronized repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:30
msgid "If a file is deleted in one repository, it is deleted in any other."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:32
msgid "It is important to note that the Nextcloud synchronization process does not use a typical client/server system where the server is always master.  This is a major difference between the Nextcloud synchronization process and other systems like a file backup, where only changes to files or folders and the addition of new files are propagated, but these files and folders are never deleted unless explicitly deleted in the backup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:39
msgid "During synchronization, the Nextcloud Client checks both repositories for changes frequently. This process is referred to as a *sync run*. In between sync runs, the local repository is monitored by a file system monitoring process that starts a sync run immediately if something was edited, added, or removed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:46
msgid "Synchronization by Time versus ETag"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:49
msgid "Until the release of the client version 1.1, the Nextcloud synchronization process employed a single file property -- the file modification time -- to decide which file was newer and needed to be synchronized to the other repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:54
msgid "The *modification timestamp* is part of the files metadata. It is available on every relevant filesystem and is the typical indicator for a file change. Modification timestamps do not require special action to create, and have a general meaning. One design goal of csync is to not require a special server component. This design goal is why csync was chosen as the backend component."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:60
msgid "To compare the modification times of two files from different systems, csync must operate on the same base. Before client version 1.1.0, csync required both device repositories to run on the exact same time.  This requirement was achieved through the use of enterprise standard `NTP time synchronization`_ on all machines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:66
msgid "Because this timing strategy is rather fragile without the use of NTP, the Nextcloud server provides a unique number that changes whenever the file changes. Although this number is a unique value, it is not a hash of the file. Instead, it is a randomly chosen number, that is transmitted in the Etag_ field. Because the file number changes if the file changes, its use is guaranteed to determine if one of the files has changed and, thereby, launching a synchronization process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:74
msgid "Before the 1.3.0 release of the Desktop Client, the synchronization process might create false conflict files if time deviates. Original and changed files conflict only in their timestamp, but not in their content. This behavior was changed to employ a binary check if files differ."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:79
msgid "Like files, directories also hold a unique ID that changes whenever one of the contained files or directories is modified. Because this is a recursive process, it significantly reduces the effort required for a synchronization cycle, because the client only analyzes directories with a modified ID."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:88
msgid "Comparison and Conflict Cases"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:90
msgid "As mentioned above, during a *sync run* the client must first detect if one of the two repositories have changed files. On the local repository, the client traverses the file tree and compares the modification time of each file with an expected value stored in its database. If the value is not the same, the client determines that the file has been modified in the local repository."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:96
msgid "On the local side, the modification time is a good attribute to use for detecting changes, because the value does not depend on time shifts and such."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:100
msgid "For the remote (that is, Nextcloud server) repository, the client compares the ETag of each file with its expected value. Again, the expected ETag value is queried from the client database. If the ETag is the same, the file has not changed and no synchronization occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:105
msgid "In the event a file has changed on both the local and the remote repository since the last sync run, it can not easily be decided which version of the file is the one that should be used. However, changes to any side will not be lost.  Instead, a *conflict case* is created. The client resolves this conflict by renaming the local file, appending a conflict label and timestamp, and saving the remote file under the original file name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:112
msgid "Example: Assume there is a conflict in message.txt because its contents have changed both locally and remotely since the last sync run. The local file with the local changes will be renamed to message_conflict-20160101-153110.txt and the remote file will be downloaded and saved as message.txt."

#: ../../architecture.rst:376
msgid "Nextcloud is built around the fundamental assumption that, as you can host your own Nextcloud server, you can trust it with your data. This assumption means data on the Nextcloud server can be provided to users through a browser interface. Users can browse their files online, access their calendars and mail and other data from the respective apps and share and collaboratively edit documents with others including guests and users without an account. While data on the server can be encrypted, this is largely designed to protect it from malicious storage solutions or theft of the whole hardware. System administrators always have access to the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:378
msgid "But for a subset of data, this assumption of trust might not hold true. For example, at an enterprise, the documents of the Human Resources department or the financial department are too sensitive to allow system administrators who manage the server, access them. As a private user, you might trust your hosting provider with the vast majority of your data but not with medical records. And even if there is trust in the server administration team, a breach of the server can never entirely be ruled out and for some data, even a tiny risk is unacceptable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:380
msgid "The Nextcloud End-to-end Encryption feature (E2EE) was designed to offer protection against a full compromise of the server. See for more details our blog about the `threat model for the encryption solutions in Nextcloud`_ and our `webpage about End-to-end Encryption`_. If the end-to-end encryption app is enabled on the server, users can use one of the clients to select a local folder and enable this feature. This will ensure the client encrypts data before it is transmitted to the server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:382
msgid "The first time E2EE is enabled on a folder in any of the clients, the user is prompted with a private key consisting of 12 security words. The user is strongly recommended to record these somewhere secure as the complete loss of this private key means there is no way to access their data anymore. The key is also securely stored in the device's key storage and can be shown on demand. Making the folder available on a second device requires entering this key. Future versions of Nextcloud clients will be able to display a QR code to simplify the process of adding devices. Sharing with other users will not require any special keys or passwords."

msgid "E2EE results in slower syncing of file and works poorly or not at all with large files and large quantities of files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:393
msgid "These limitations are fundamental to how securely implemented end-to-end encryption works. We realize there are some solutions that call their technology 'end-to-end encryption' but with browser access. Reality is that offering browser access to end-to-end encrypted files would essentially negate any of the benefits of end-to-end encryption. Serving a file in the browser means the server needs to be able to read the files. But if the server can read the files, administrator or a malicious attacker who gained access to the server, can too. Decrypting the file in the browser does not solve this security risk in the least, as the javascript code that would be needed to decrypt the file comes FROM the server, and of course a compromised server would simply send modified javascript code which sends a copy of the encryption keys to the attacker without anybody noticing. See for more details our blog about the `threat model for the encryption solutions in Nextcloud`_ and our `webpage about End-to-end Encryption`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:395
msgid "The E2EE design of Nextcloud allows for sharing on a per-folder level to individual users (not groups), but, as of early 2021, this feature is still on the road map for implementation in the clients."
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.rst:397
msgid "Due to all these limitations that are inherent to true end-to-end encryption, it is only recommended for a small subset of files, in just a small number of folders. Encrypting your entire sync folder is likely to result in poor performance and sync errors and if you do not trust your server at all, Nextcloud is perhaps not the right solution for your use case. You might instead want to use encrypted archives or another solution."

msgid "Oftentimes, users are working with a huge amount of files that are big in size. Synchronizing every such file to a device that's running a Nextcloud desktop client is not always possible due to the user's device storage space limitation. Let's assume that your desktop client is connected to a server that has 1TB of data. You want all those files at hand, so you can quickly access any file via the file explorer. Your device has 512GB local storage device. Obviously, it's not possible to synchronize even half of 1TB of data that is on the server. What should you do in this case? Of course, you can just utilize the Selective Sync feature, and keep switching between different folders, in such a way that you only synchronize those folders that you are currently working with. Needless to say, this is far from being convenient."
