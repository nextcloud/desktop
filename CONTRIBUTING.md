## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks for wanting to contribute source code to Nextcloud. That's great!

We ask that you follow our [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/code-of-conduct/).

Please read the [Contribution Guide](https://nextcloud.com/contribute/) to get 
started and follow the [Coding Style](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/wiki/Coding-Style)
when writing new code.

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin).
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
