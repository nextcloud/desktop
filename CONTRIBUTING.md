### Bug Reporting Guidelines

- **Important**: When reporting an issue provide as much requested information as possible, we :heart: log files.
- **SECURITY**: Report any potential security bug to security@owncloud.com following our [security policy](https://owncloud.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker
- This repository is _only_ for issues within the ownCloud desktop client.
  Issues in other components should be reported in their own repositores:
  - [ownCloud server](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues)
  - [ownCloud apps](https://github.com/owncloud/apps/issues) (e.g. Calendar,
    Contacts...)
  - [Android client](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues)
  - [iOS client](https://github.com/owncloud/ios-issues/issues)
- Search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already
  reported.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
