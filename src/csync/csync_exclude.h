     * The optimization works in two steps: First, all supported patterns are put
     * into _fullRegexFile/_fullRegexDir. These regexes can be applied to the full
     * path to determine whether it is excluded or not.
     *
     * The second is a performance optimization. The particularly common use
     * case for excludes during a sync run is "traversal": Instead of checking
     * the full path every time, we check each parent path with the traversal
     * function incrementally.
     *
     * Example: When the sync run eventually arrives at "a/b/c it can assume
     * that the traversal matching has already been run on "a", "a/b"
     * and just needs to run the traversal matcher on "a/b/c".
     *
     * The full matcher is equivalent to or-combining the traversal match results
     * of all parent paths:
     *   full("a/b/c/d") == traversal("a") || traversal("a/b") || traversal("a/b/c")
     *
     * The traversal matcher can be extremely fast because it has a fast early-out
     * case: It checks the bname part of the path against _bnameTraversalRegex
     * and only runs a simplified _fullTraversalRegex on the whole path if bname
     * activation for it was triggered.
     *
     * Note: The traversal matcher will return not-excluded on some paths that the
     * full matcher would exclude. Example: "b" is excluded. traversal("b/c")
     * returns not-excluded because "c" isn't a bname activation pattern.
