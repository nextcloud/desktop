/**
 * The main function in the reconcile pass.
 *
 * It's called for each entry in the local and remote files by
 * csync_reconcile()
 *
 * Before the reconcile phase the trees already know about changes
 * relative to the sync journal. This function's job is to spot conflicts
 * between local and remote changes and adjust the nodes accordingly.
 *
 * See doc/dev/sync-algorithm.md for an overview.
 *
 *
 * Older detail comment:
 *
 * We merge replicas at the file level. The merged replica contains the
 * superset of files that are on the local machine and server copies of
 * the replica. In the case where the same file is in both the local
 * and server copy, the file that was modified most recently is used.
 * This means that new files are not deleted, and updated versions of
 * existing files are not overwritten.
 *
 * When a file is updated, the merge algorithm compares the destination
 * file with the the source file. If the destination file is newer
 * (timestamp is newer), it is not overwritten. If both files, on the
 * source and the destination, have been changed, the newer file wins.
