/**
 * Job that handles discovery of a directory.
 *
 * This includes:
 *  - Do a DiscoverySingleDirectoryJob network job which will do a PROPFIND of this directory
 *  - Stat all the entries in the local file system for this directory
 *  - Merge all information (and the information from the database) in order to know what needs
 *    to be done for every file within this directory.
 *  - For every sub-directory within this directory, "recursively" create a new ProcessDirectoryJob.
 *
 * This job is tightly coupled with the DiscoveryPhase class.
 *
 * After being start()'ed this job will perform work asynchronously and emit finished() when done.
 *
 * Internally, this job will call DiscoveryPhase::scheduleMoreJobs when one of its sub-jobs is
 * finished. DiscoveryPhase::scheduleMoreJobs will call processSubJobs() to continue work until
 * the job is finished.
 *
 * Results are fed outwards via the DiscoveryPhase::itemDiscovered() signal.
