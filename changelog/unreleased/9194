Bugfix: Don't abort upload if chunk is locked

Since 2.9 we know that we need exclusive file access to a file to properly handle it with Windows virtual files.
Therefore we checked for the locked state before we start the upload.
Due to a bug we checked that for each file chunk, now we only check when the upload starts and when it finished completely.
