Bugfix: A upgrade to 2.9 causes the usage of a new journal file

We fixed a bug where the name of the sync journal was not properly saved to the settings.
This caused a bug when migration to 2.9, so a new a new sync journal was created.

This not only caused the loss of some selective sync settings, but also caused the display of the following warning message:

```
Multiple accounts are sharing the folder.
This configuration is know to lead to dataloss and is no longer supported.
Please consider removing this folder from the account and adding it again.
```
