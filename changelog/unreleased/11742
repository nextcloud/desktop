Change: New update channel for ownCloud infinite scale

The release series 6 is a long term release.
As version 7 will drop the support for ownCloud 10, users will either have to select the ownCloud infinite scale update channel in the about dialog or manually install a newer release.
This change only affects the unbranded version.
