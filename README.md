## Introduction

The ownCloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from ownCloud Server
with your computer.

## Download

### Binary packages

* Refer to the download page https://owncloud.com/desktop-app/

### Source code

The ownCloud Desktop Client is developed in Git. Since Git makes it easy to
fork and improve the source code and to adapt it to your need, many copies
can be found on the Internet, in particular on GitHub. However, the
authoritative repository maintained by the developers is located at
https://github.com/owncloud/client.

## Building the source code

[Building the Client](https://doc.owncloud.com/desktop/next/appendices/building.html)
in the ownCloud Desktop Client manual.
