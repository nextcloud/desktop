### Bug fixing and development

> [!TIP]
> For building the client on macOS we have a tool called `mac-crafter`.
> You will find more information about it in [its dedicated README](admin/osx/mac-crafter/README.md).

#### 1. 🚀 Set up your local development environment

> [!NOTE]  
> Find the system requirements and instructions on [how to work on Windows with KDE Craft](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop-client-blueprints/) on our [desktop client blueprints repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop-client-blueprints/).

1.1 System requirements
- [Windows 10, Windows 11](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop-client-blueprints/), macOS 10.14 Mojave (or newer) or Linux
- [🔽 Inkscape (to generate icons)](https://inkscape.org/release/)
- Developer tools: cmake, clang/gcc/g++:
- Qt6 since 3.14, Qt5 for earlier versions
- OpenSSL
- [🔽 QtKeychain](https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain)
- SQLite

1.2 Optional

1.3 Step by step instructions on how to build the client to contribute
1. Clone the Github repository:

cd <build directory>
cmake -S <cloned desktop repo> -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<dependencies> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. -DNEXTCLOUD_DEV=ON
```

> [!TIP]
> The cmake variable NEXTCLOUD_DEV allows you to run your own build of the client while developing in parallel with an installed version of the client.
