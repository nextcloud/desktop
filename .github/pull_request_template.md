Thanks for opening a pull request on the Nextcloud desktop client.

Instead of a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) we use a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin

To accept that DCO, please make sure that you add a line like
Signed-off-by: Random Developer <random@developer.example.org>
at the end of each commit message.

This Signed-off-by trailer can be added automatically by git if you pass --signoff or -s to git commit.
